                At the time, there weren&apos;t many real estate listing applications in
                the New Zealand market. The main competitor in the real estate website
                space was TradeMe Property, which was a subsidiary of the popular trading
                website TradeMe. Apart from that, the only other options were individual
                real estate agent-operated websites, which were not perfect apps but
                rather web apps, making them no different from a blue ocean perspective.

                Therefore, our goal was to create an application that would perfectly
                address the shortcomings and inconveniences of TradeMe, our only
                competitor, and to further study the Australian real estate website and
                application market for improvement ideas and inspiration.
