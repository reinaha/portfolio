                Around the year 2018, there weren&apos;t many real estate listing
                applications in the New Zealand market. The main competitor in the real
                estate website space was TradeMe Property, which was a subsidiary of the
                popular trading website TradeMe. Apart from that, other options were
                mainly individual real estate agent-operated websites. As these were web
                applications, a real estate trading application with native mobile
                application appeared as a blue ocean.

                The goal of the project was to create an application that would perfectly
                address the shortcomings and inconveniences of TradeMe, drawing
                inspiration from Australian real estate websites and applications to
                enhance user experience.
