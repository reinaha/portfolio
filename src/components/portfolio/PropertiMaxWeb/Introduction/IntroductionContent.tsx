                When we began working on the Propertimax website project, the New Zealand
                market lacked an active real estate sales website. The leading player in
                the market was TradeMe Property, which originated from a popular trading
                website, and there were other websites operated by real estate agents.
                However, TradeMe Property was not solely focused on real estate, and its
                UIs had an old-fashioned style that made users feel uncomfortable when
                purchasing expensive properties. We saw an opportunity to create a real
                estate-specific sales website that could offer a more user-friendly and
                modern experience.

                Initially, my role in the project was to complete the unfinished designs
                from the previous designer and do some basic publishing using HTML and
                CSS. However, upon reviewing the previous designs, I found them to be
                incomplete and insufficient. After the administrator requested
                modifications, we decided to completely redesign all the previous designs
                to meet our goal of creating a modern and user-friendly real estate sales
                website.
