                My mission was to design a dashboard website that would help manage
                property listings and updates for PropertiMax&apos;s primary site. Since
                the main target audience was agents who rely heavily on the website, my
                focus was on providing an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard. While
                there was no direct competition for this support tool, I wanted to ensure
                that agents had access to an effective and efficient platform to manage
                their properties.

                Initially, my role in the PropertiMax dashboard project was to finalise
                the incomplete designs from the previous designer and to publish them
                using HTML and CSS. However, upon reviewing the previous designs, I found
                them incomplete in design, and the administrator requested modifications.
                Thus, I spearheaded a complete redesign of all the previous designs to
                ensure that the PropertiMax dashboard met the needs of agents.
