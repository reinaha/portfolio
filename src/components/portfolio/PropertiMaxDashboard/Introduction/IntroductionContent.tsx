                At the time, the New Zealand market did not have an active real estate
                sales website. The leading player in the real estate market was TradeMe
                Property, which came from the popular trading website TradeMe, and there
                were also websites operated by real estate agents.

                TradeMe Property was not a website solely focused on real estate since it
                originated from a second-hand trading website, and as it had been around
                for a long time, many of its UIs maintained an old-fashioned style. This
                often made users feel uncomfortable when purchasing expensive properties
                like real estate, and we aimed to create a real estate-specific sales
                website that could focus solely on real estate.

                My role in the Propertimax website project was to complete the unfinished
                designs from the previous designer and to do simple publishing using HTML
                and CSS. However, I decided that the completeness of the previous designs
                was insufficient and the administrator requested modifications, so we
                started by completely redesigning all of the previous designs.
