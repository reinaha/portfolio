                I was tasked with designing a website that serves as a dashboard for
                managing property listings and updates for the PropertiMax main site.

            <Typography>
                As a support tool for the main website, there wasn&apos;t necessarily any
                direct competition, but since one of PropertiMax&apos;s main targets is
                agents who primarily use the website, I focused on providing an
                easy-to-use and convenient dashboard for agents.

                My role in the Propertimax dashboard project was to complete the
                unfinished designs from the previous designer and to do simple publishing
                using HTML and CSS. However, I decided that the completeness of the
                previous designs was insufficient and the administrator requested
                modifications, so we started by completely redesigning all of the previous
                designs.
