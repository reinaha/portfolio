                As this app was created to sell products for a specific industry, it was
                essential to first understand the needs and pain points of the target
                audience, specifically dentists, and what features would provide most
                value to them.

                This required listening to complaints from dentists, as well as
                investigating other dental suppliers and competitors. Additionally, it was
                necessary to continuously collect feedback from the target audience after
                the wireframe was developed.

                Through this process, I learned the importance of understanding target

                Although there wasnâ€™t an existing e-commerce platform, the company had
                already established relationships with customers through face-to-face

            </IconListItem>
            <IconListItem iconType="noIcon">
                Therefore, it was important to take into consideration the onboarding
                process to bring existing customers into the new e-commerce app rather
                than targeting new customers. This required careful consideration of
                existing company systems and processes in addition to designing the app to
                help clients adapt to the new purchasing process.
            </IconListItem>
            <IconListItem iconType="noIcon">
                To design such a system, it was necessary to understand the company&apos;s
                internal sales system and to understand the specific aspects and
                purchasing patterns of how certain clients make orders when making
                purchases.

                While creating an e-commerce application for the dental industry, I gained
                valuable insights into the unique requirements and challenges of this
                particular industry. The products being sold were very specialised and had
                a range of different options that was difficult to understand in the
                beginning.

                Learning more about the industry and the products allowed me to design a
